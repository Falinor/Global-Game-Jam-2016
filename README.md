# Global-Game-Jam-2016
This is the project my team and I made during the Global Game Jam 2016 edition!

Our game is called *Notice me N'Masha !*

In the kingdom of Mach'Mbr, the four Magelords Monk (Standing for earthbound wisdom), Usur (Red burning violence), Lacom (The dark night) and Odh (The bright day) face each others to death during the ceremony of the temple Eup'Lu in hope to be recognized and be favored by the great godess N'Mash.
Notice me N'Masha is a Free for all Towerfall like game. From 2 to 4 players, the character you control go through cycles of attacks without you having a control over it.
The only thing you can do (Beside moving, jumping and aiming like you're gonna get killed in one hit, which is what is gonna happen) is changing which cycle you're using.
You have basically one short range cycle and one long range cycle with eache having 3 attacks. Additionally, you get a third cycle that will charge a unique LD Event.
It is up to you to figure each attack out, but here are two quick tips : Melee attacks reflect ranged attacks, and each attack has it's own uniqueness.

Hope you enjoy our game.
